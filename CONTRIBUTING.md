# Contributing

If you discover issues, have ideas for improvements or new features, please
report them to the [issue tracker][1] of the repository or submit a pull
request. Please, try to follow these guidelines when you do so.

## Issue reporting

* Check that the issue has not already been reported.
* Check that the issue has not already been fixed in the latest code
  (a.k.a. `main`).
* Be clear, concise and precise in your description of the problem.
* Open an issue with a descriptive title and a summary in grammatically correct,
  complete sentences.
* Include a screenshot illustrating the issue.

## Pull requests

* Read the [design principles][6] to understand the color semantics and
  conventions used throughout the theme.
* Use a topic branch to easily amend a pull request later, if necessary.
* Write [good commit messages][2].
* Mention related tickets in the commit messages (e.g. `[Fix #N] Add missing face for ...`).
* Update the [changelog][3].
* Use the same coding conventions as the rest of the project.
* Verify your Emacs Lisp code with `checkdoc` (`C-c ? d`).
* Add a before/after screenshot illustrating your changes visually.
* [Squash related commits together][4].
* Open a [pull request][5] that relates to *only* one subject with a clear title
  and description in grammatically correct, complete sentences.
